# reiz.io

Reiz is a search engine for source code on syntactic level. It is a multi-stage
process that starts from collecting most used Python projects and ends with a HTTP
API that takes an intermediate pattern match language called, [ReizQL](docs/reizql.md).

For creating a new instance, please check out the "[deploy guide](docs/deploy_guide.md)". For any
other question, feel free to start up a new [discussion](https://github.com/reizio/reiz.io/discussions).
